# Search CLI

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Search CLI is a simple search cli tool which makes searching in the given dataset at ease

![](example-screenshot.png)

## Features

  - Case insensitive search for any field of organization, user, ticket entity
  - Return all relavent entities ( i.e. searching user by name should return all its relavent tickets and organizations.)
  - Search empty field ( i.e. can search even where field is empty.)
  - Display error when invalid field or value is provided

## Trade-off  
  - Extra space and time are required in order to convert array of objects into map
  - But map will reduce the time for searching from O(n) to O(log(n))
  - Can dramatically improve performance when the size of data grows

## Installation

Search CLI requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v8.12.0+ to run.
